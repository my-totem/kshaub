The WordPress Curated List Manager Knowledge Base Plugin by CreativeMinds allows you to build curated lists of links and information all arranged by categories.

Each curated list list can be shown using a shortcode on any page or post and users can filter the information by a live search filter, by categories or by tags.

The actively curated list is easy to use, easy to customize, and works with any theme. The curated list manager plugin lets users easily integrate lists within WordPress.

The curated list manager plugin is a great content marketing tool which allows users to build favorite lists, recommend content lists or arrange knowledge around clusters of categories and subcategories.

This is also a great tool for building a professional knowledgebase of all related articles and links to a specific subject area.

It is also possible to add a checkbox near each item, therefore making it into an assignment list which users can mark what they did and the plugin will save it based on a cookie assigned to the user.
